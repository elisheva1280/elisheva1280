👋 Hi, I'm Elisheva Cohen
Full Stack Software Developer with a strong engineering mindset and hands-on experience building
production-ready, client-facing systems.
I focus on writing clean, maintainable code, designing clear API contracts, and delivering end-to-end
features from technical specification to working production solutions. I value good architecture, clear
separation of concerns, and predictable system behavior.

End-to-end development of full stack systems used by real users
Designing backend APIs with clear contracts, validation, and error handling
Building data-driven React applications with a strong UX focus
Applying Clean Architecture and layered design principles
Translating requirements into technical designs and implementation
Working in Agile teams with shared ownership and code quality standards

🌱 How I Approach Development
I start by understanding the problem and constraints, not just the solution
I design APIs and components with future change in mind
I prefer clarity over cleverness and predictable behavior over hidden magic
I treat testing, validation, and error handling as part of the feature—not extras
