# 👋 Hi, I'm Elisheva Cohen

**Full Stack Software Developer** with hands-on experience building **production-ready, end-to-end systems** used by real users.

I enjoy working across the full stack — designing backend APIs, building reliable frontend experiences, and connecting the two into cohesive, maintainable products. I value clear architecture, clean code, and predictable system behavior, and I take ownership of features from technical specification through production.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Develop **end-to-end full stack features** from requirements to production  
- Design and implement **RESTful APIs** with validation and clear contracts  
- Build **data-driven React applications** with a strong focus on UX and state management  
- Implement business logic, background tasks, and system workflows  
- Translate product and design requirements into technical solutions  
- Work in **Agile teams** with shared ownership, code reviews, and quality standards
